# Project Title: Linear Regression on Housing Prices
# Overview of the Project:
  This project demonstrates the use of a Linear Regression model for predicting house prices based on various features such as the size of the house, number of rooms, location, and more. The dataset used in this project is a typical housing dataset containing several features that influence the price of a house.
  House price prediction is a common application of machine learning, particularly in the real estate industry. This project focuses on the following:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and transforming categorical variables into numerical representations.
    Handling Missing Values: Filling or removing missing data to ensure the dataset is complete.
    Encoding Categorical Variables: Converting categorical variables into numerical format using techniques such as one-hot encoding.
Model Training: Training a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on the features provided in the dataset.
    Linear Regression: A basic yet powerful model that assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the target variable (house price).
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
    Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
    Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.
    R-squared: A statistical measure that indicates how well the regression model fits the data.
